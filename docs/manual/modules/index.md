title: Modules
---

Gambit supports multiple modularization approaches and constructs: legacy
modules, primitive modules and R7RS compatible modules. These are described in
that order, which corresponds to increased abstraction level. Unless there is a
need for detailed control over the modules, it is best to use the R7RS
compatible module system for the development of new code.
